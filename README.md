# SQL-Task2

Task 2 â€“ Data Insertion and Cleaning (Library Management System)

Objective:
In this task, I added sample data to the tables created in Task 1 using INSERT INTO. I also handled missing values using NULL and cleaned some data using UPDATE and DELETE statements with WHERE conditions.

What I Did:

Inserted data into all tables: Author, Book, Member, Borrow, and Book_Author

Used NULL for missing values (like publication year or email)

Updated missing data using UPDATE

Deleted a sample record using DELETE with WHERE

Disabled safe update mode temporarily to allow some update queries

Commands Used:

INSERT INTO to add rows

UPDATE to fix missing values

DELETE to remove a sample record

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0; to disable safe update restriction

Outcome:
Now the database has some real data which is clean and consistent. All tables are ready for future queries and use.
